## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<br>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<br>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ClientHubParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* The `Command` objects contain examples of the appropriate format of the command, as well as the data passed in by the user
(e.g. `Person` object to be added in an `AddCommand` object)
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* handles predicate determination for keyword comparison of attributes in all `Person` objects
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative model is given below. It has a `Set<Product>` in `Person`. This allows `AddressBook` to only
require one `Product` object per unique product, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Product` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

<br>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ClientHubStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is implemented in `ModelManager` with two stacks of deep-copied `AddressBook` states:

- `undoStack`: history of previous states
- `redoStack`: history of states that were undone and can be restored

Operations that modify stored data (e.g., `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `clear`) push a snapshot of the current `AddressBook` onto `undoStack` BEFORE applying the change, and CLEAR the `redoStack`.

- `setAddressBook(...)`: pushes a snapshot, clears `redoStack`, then replaces the state
- `addPerson(...)`: pushes a snapshot, clears `redoStack`, then adds
- `setPerson(...)`: pushes a snapshot, clears `redoStack`, then updates
- `deletePerson(...)`: pushes a snapshot, clears `redoStack`, then removes

Atomicity: For batch-like operations (e.g., delete-by-status), the command constructs an updated copy and calls `model.setAddressBook(updated)` ONCE so the entire batch is treated as a single undoable action.

`undo()`:
- Fails if `undoStack` is empty (`canUndo() == false`)
- Pushes the current state to `redoStack`
- Pops the top from `undoStack` and restores it via `addressBook.resetData(previous)`

`redo()`:
- Fails if `redoStack` is empty (`canRedo() == false`)
- Pushes the current state to `undoStack`
- Pops the top from `redoStack` and restores it via `addressBook.resetData(next)`

Command routing:
- `UndoCommand#execute` calls `model.undo()`; `RedoCommand#execute` calls `model.redo()`
- The parser recognizes `undo` and `redo` keywords and instantiates the respective commands

Persistence:
- After a command executes, `LogicManager` saves the current `AddressBook` via `storage.saveAddressBook(model.getAddressBook())`. This includes states after `undo` and `redo`, ensuring the reverted or restored state is persisted.

Diagrams:
- The existing undo/redo sequence diagrams remain applicable conceptually (command executes through Logic into Model, which reverts/restores the in-memory state and then is saved).

#### Design considerations

- Chosen approach: Snapshot the entire `AddressBook` for each modifying command
  - Pros: Simple and robust
  - Cons: Higher memory usage for large datasets
- Alternative: Command-specific inverse operations
  - Pros: Lower memory footprint
  - Cons: Higher complexity; more room for errors across many commands

## **Planned Enhancements**

Team Size: 5

1. Currently, our name field does not allow characters like `-` and `/`.
This might be problematic as those symbols are used in legal names commonly seen in Singapore.
We plan to refine name field in the future such that it can take in these symbols and accept names like
`Karthik s/o Ramesh` when creating a new client.
2. Currently, our GUI is not capable of showing name, email and company fields that are too long,
as the GUI truncates those fields, ending them off with `...`.
This is problematic as we will lose those values to the truncation.
We plan to wrap those fields to one line below when it is too long, hence preserving the values.
3. Currently, when executing the `edit` command,
users are allowed to replace the current value of an attribute field with the same value.
This may be a missed opportunity to detect potential typos or slips from users,
as they might have accidentally typed the old value instead of new value.
We plan to give an error message when users try to replace an attribute field with the same value as before.
4. Currently, after successfully editing an attribute field, the success message shown shows every field of the client.
That might be problematic as it might cause confusion to users who want to double-check the changes made.
We plan to update the success message such that it only shows the attribute field that was change,
and what value it was changed from and to.
5. Currently, our whole GUI might not fit everyone's screen resolution, forcing some users to scroll to access products.
We plan to resize the GUI or shift the elements such that they are more compacted,
allowing more users to be able to see the whole GUI on their screen.
6. Currently, when user omits a compulsory attribute field when adding a client,
the error message does not specify which field is missing.
This leads to poor User Experience as users may need to spend additional time to identify which field is missing.
We plan to refine the error message when users miss out on compulsory fields,
such that it specifies which fields are missing, saving users the troubles of trying to identify the missing fields.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* sales representatives
* tired of messy and complicated Excel sheets
* wants more efficient and seamless experience tracking potential clients
* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:
Sales representatives will have more efficient control over tracking their client interaction and progress,
thereby improving their operational efficiency. This is especially so for users who are more comfortable with
CLIs compared to GUIs which can be complex and overwhelming

4. The client list should be stored locally and be in a human editable text file.
5. ClientHub should be able to work without requiring an installer.
6. The GUI of ClientHub should not have any resolution-related inconveniences for the user, standard screen resolutions 1920x1080 and higher, and for screen scales 100% and 125%.
7. The GUI of ClientHub should be usable, even if user experience is not optimal, for resolutions 1280x720 and higher, and for screen scales 150%.
8. ClientHub should still be functional even if new commands, fields, or parameters are added in the future.
9. The commands should not take more than 5 seconds to run and carry out its response.
10. ClientHub should be usable by someone who cannot remember the commands, or is new to ClientHub.
11. ClientHub should not handle communication between clients and sales representatives.
12. Client list should be persistent and not change unless edited with a command or through text editor by user.
13. Users should not be able to see each others' client lists, they should be private and visible only to the current user.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   Handling data file issues

   i. Missing data file

   - Test case: Delete or rename `addressbook.json`. Start the application.
     
     Expected: Application starts using sample data. No error dialog is shown. A new data file will be created on the next successful save.

   ii. Corrupted data file (invalid JSON or illegal values)
   
   - Prerequisites: Application is closed. You know the data file path.
   - Test case: Open `addressbook.json` and intentionally corrupt it (e.g. delete a closing brace, change field names, insert invalid values). Start the application.
     
     Expected: Application logs that the file could not be loaded and starts with an empty AddressBook. No crash; application remains usable.

   iii. Permission error on save
   
   - Prerequisites: Data file exists at `[JAR location]/data/addressbook.json`.
   - Test case (macOS/Linux): Make the data file or its folder read-only (e.g. `chmod a-w [JAR location]/data` or `chmod a-w addressbook.json`). Start the application and execute a modifying command (e.g. `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`).
     
     Expected: Command executes in memory but saving fails. An error message is shown: "Could not save data to file ... due to insufficient permissions ..." (or a generic file I/O error). After restoring write permissions and executing another modifying command, saving succeeds.
