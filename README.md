## Overview
ClientHub is a **Command Line Interface (CLI) contact management application**
built specifically for sales representatives based in Singapore.
Unlike spreadsheets or complicated Customer Relationship Management(CRM) Tools,
ClientHub provides a **fast, lightweight, and efficient way to track clients,
manage interactions, and monitor progress**, all with a CLI.

Our goal is to give sales representatives a **seamless client tracking experience**
so they can spend less time wrestling with messy tools and more time securing deals.
