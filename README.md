## Overview
ClientHub is a **Command Line Interface (CLI) contact management application** built specifically for sales representatives. Unlike spreadsheets or complicated CRMs, ClientHub provides a **fast, lightweight, and efficient way to track clients, manage interactions, and monitor progress**, all with a CLI.

Our goal is to give sales representatives a **seamless client tracking experience** so they can spend less time wrestling with messy tools and more time securing deals.

## Features (MVP)
The current version of ClientHub includes the following core features:

- **Add client**: Create new client entries with details such as name, phone number, and email.  
- **Delete client**: Remove clients who are no longer relevant.  
- **View all clients**: Display all saved client entries at a glance.  

---

## Planned Features
Beyond the MVP, ClientHub aims to support sales reps with additional productivity features such as:
- Editing client details  
- Filtering and sorting client lists  
- Tracking client statuses and onboarding progress  
- Importing contacts from Excel/CSV  
- Exporting client lists to share with colleagues  
- Adding notes, tags, or grouping clients by product or status
